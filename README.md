# Phishy
A simple extention for avoiding phishing emails in Gmail.
How It Works
This extension enhances your email security by:

Automatically highlighting emails suspected of phishing in red.
Marking emails from senders on your blacklist with a dark red border.
Allowing you to curate a personal blacklist of suspicious email addresses or domains below.
Please Note: Highlighting serves as a precautionary alert. Always exercise your own judgment before interacting with any email.
